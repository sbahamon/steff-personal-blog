## Why?

The term master has a bad history behind it - don't take my word for it, take the[ Washington Post's.](<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/12/tech-industry-has-an-ugly-master-slave-problem/>) Changing our terminology from master branches to main branches is a really simple change to make, and it helps make tech a more inclusive place. What's not to like?

## How?

1. create a main branch on git

2. change the default main branch on github
3. add the branch in yaml config file
4. change the branch in netlify cms
