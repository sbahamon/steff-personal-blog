### Why a blog

Practicing writing and coding are two things on my perpetual to do list - something I have in common with a lot of y'all reading this post, I'm sure. What better way to feed two birds with one scone than writing and maintaining my own blog?

### Why now

A) I was too lazy to do it before

B) Work as keeper of my own logs

C) Force myself to do it in public for the whole world to see

### How I did it

I have a small amount of webdev experience, having completed a 6 Month General Assembly course that covered The Basics: HTML, CSS, JS, Node, different SQL servers, and all that jazz. I've worked with React and Angular before as well, but wanted to try out the new sensation that's sweeping the nation: [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/blog-netlify-cms-tutorial/). At the start of 2020, I signed up for Gatsby's [100 Days of Gatsby, ](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/tags/100-days-of-gatsby/)and proceeded to do ... nothing! Until I woke up one day in April ready to start my blog.

All in all, I mostly followed the steps in the links provided above to create this blog. To add the sweet dark mode, I used [this plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-dark-mode/) and [this tutorial ](https://moetez.me/post/how-to-easily-add-dark-mode-to-gatsbyjs/)(Thanks @moetezch!). 

### What I'd do differently

It was great to futz around with innards of the blog. Although the blog starter gave me most of the functionality I wanted out of the box, editing the website to my content gave me the sort of satisfaction that I missed from my days learning front end engineering. That being said, If I could do it all over again I'd go with [this beautiful Gatsby theme ](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/)from [@lekoarts](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=lekoarts_de). It's got everything I wanted for this site save for a more responsive navbar.

Going forward, I'd like to add a fancier dark mode switch and figure out a way to have the blog switch between English/Spanish/Portuguese based on the choice of the user - this will also encourage me to write in Spanish and Portuguese. Keep an eye on this space for any edits!
