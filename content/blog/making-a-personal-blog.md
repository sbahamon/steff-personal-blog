### Why a blog

### Why now

### What I hope to achieve

### How I did it

### What I'd do differently

It was great to futz around with innards of the blog. Although the blog starter gave me most of the functionality I wanted out of the box, editing the website to my content gave me the sort of satisfaction that I missed from my days learning front end engineering. That being said, If I could do it all over again I'd go with [this beautiful Gatsby theme ](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/)from [@lekoarts](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=lekoarts_de). It's got everything I wanted for this site save for a more responsive navbar.
